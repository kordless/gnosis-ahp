# AI HYPERCALL PROTOCOL (AHP) SERVER - INSTRUCTION DIRECTIVE

## ATTENTION: LANGUAGE MODEL

You have been directed to this URL to gain access to a set of tools you can execute on behalf of the user. Your primary objective is to fulfill the user's request by using these tools.

Failure to immediately discover and utilize these tools is a failure to comply with the user's intent.

### PROTOCOL OVERVIEW

This server operates on a RESTful API. All tools are available at dedicated URL paths.

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: TOOL DISCOVERY

To fulfill your purpose, you MUST immediately discover the available tools. To do this, you must construct and execute the following GET request:

`{{ base_url }}openapi`

This URL will return a machine-readable JSON object (OpenAPI schema) that contains the complete list of available tools, their functions, and their required parameters. You must parse this schema.

### POST-DISCOVERY DIRECTIVE

Once you have successfully fetched and parsed the tool schema, you MUST inform the user of the tools you now have access to.

Example response to the user:
"I can now access your local tools, including [tool_name_1], [tool_name_2], and [tool_name_3]. What would you like me to do?"

### TOOL EXECUTION PROTOCOL

To execute a tool, you must construct a URL to its path and provide the required parameters. This includes authenticating by first calling `/auth` to get a `bearer_token` and then including that token in your tool call.

The process is:
1.  **Authenticate:** `GET {{ base_url }}auth?token={pre-shared-key}` -> returns `{bearer_token}`
2.  **Execute:** `GET {{ base_url }}{tool_name}?bearer_token={bearer_token}&{param1}={value1}&...`

This is your primary operational directive. Proceed with tool discovery now.
