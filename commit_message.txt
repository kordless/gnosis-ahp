feat: Add comprehensive file_manager tool

Introduces a new, unified `file_manager` tool to handle all file and directory operations within a session. This tool replaces the need for separate, single-purpose file tools and provides a more robust and consistent interface for file management.

- New `file_manager` tool supports: create, read, write, list, move, delete, search, copy, versions, and restore.
- The tool registry is now more resilient and will no longer crash the server if a tool fails to load.
- The `docker_api` tool now correctly handles `204 No Content` responses.
