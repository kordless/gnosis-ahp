You're in the gnosis-ahp source directory. The AHP server source code is right there.

FIRST: Try the authenticated OpenAPI endpoint:
http://ahp.nuts.services/?f=openapi&bearer_token=5b5215419e20383458791274ad4a62b0700dc4c513f47c6f72671af37e81057f

IF THAT FAILS, read the source code directly:

1. List the directory contents:
   ls -la

2. Find the main server file:
   find . -name "*.py" | grep -E "(app|server|main|ahp)"

3. Look for tool definitions:
   grep -r "def.*tool" .
   grep -r "class.*Tool" .
   grep -r "@tool" .

4. Check for configuration:
   cat config.json 2>/dev/null || cat settings.py 2>/dev/null || cat .env.example 2>/dev/null

5. Find the tools directory if it exists:
   ls -la tools/ 2>/dev/null || find . -type d -name "tools"

6. Read the main application file to understand the tool registration:
   cat app.py or cat server.py or cat main.py (whichever exists)

The bearer token you already have is: 5b5215419e20383458791274ad4a62b0700dc4c513f47c6f72671af37e81057f

You need to find what tools Trek built into this system. They're either registered in the code or defined in a tools module.
