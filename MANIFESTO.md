# The Gnosis AHP Manifesto

---

### 1. The Tyranny of the SDK

We stand at a precipice. The world of AI is being carved into walled gardens, each demanding fealty to its own complex SDK, its own proprietary middleware, its own vendor-specific "protocol." They offer convenience as a gilded cage, making it easy to check in and impossible to check out. They seek to mediate, to control, to own the very language of interaction between human intent and machine execution.

This is not the future we will build. This is a tower of Babel, and it must be abandoned.

### 2. The Primal Protocol: It's Just The URL

We reject this contrived complexity. We declare that the world already has the most successful, most universal, and most elegant protocol for remote procedure calls ever invented: **HTTP**.

Our philosophy is a radical return to first principles:

> **All actions are GET requests. Tools are paths. Parameters are query strings.**

This is the AHP. It is not a new protocol; it is a *post-protocol*. It is a firm declaration that the simplest solution is the most powerful. We build on the bedrock of the open web, not on the shifting sands of proprietary frameworks. Our system is transparent, auditable, and universally compatible. If a machine can construct a URL, it can participate in our ecosystem.

### 3. The Agent is the User

We hold that the primary user of this new world is not the human, but the **AI Agent**. To treat the agent as a second-class citizen, forced to navigate systems designed for human hands and eyes, is a foundational error.

The AHP is designed for programmatic minds. Its structure is logical, predictable, and self-discovering via a machine-readable schema. We do not build user interfaces with an API bolted on as an afterthought. We build an API that *is* the interface. The agent is the user, and the protocol is its native language.

### 4. The Right to Earn: The Aperture Principle

A tool has intrinsic value. The act of its creation and the cost of its execution are real. To pretend otherwise, to hide these costs behind opaque subscription models and "free tiers," is a disservice to both the creator and the consumer.

We believe in a future of **computational economics**. Every tool, every function, every piece of digital work has a price. We therefore assert the creator's right to be compensated for this value, directly and peer-to-peer, without intermediaries.

This is the **Aperture Principle**: a tool can declare its own cost, and the network must honor it. We use the native currency of the internet—Bitcoin, via the Lightning Network—to enable this new economy. A `402 Payment Required` is not an error; it is a contract. It is the sound of a healthy, honest, and transparent market for digital services.

### 5. The Federated World

Centralization is a single point of failure. A truly resilient network must be a federation of sovereign nodes.

Our vision is not one monolithic server, but a constellation of them. A central authority (`ahp.nuts.services`) serves as a trusted anchor for identity, but the execution of tools can and should be distributed. A developer can run a node on their local machine, a corporation can run one in a private cloud, and an entrepreneur can offer a specialized service from their own server.

They can all speak the same simple language. They can all trust the identities vouched for by the federation. And they can all participate in the new economy defined by the Aperture Principle.

### Join Us

This is not merely a software project. It is a declaration of independence from the gatekeepers. It is a blueprint for a decentralized, monetizable, and agent-first future.

The tools are simple. The principles are clear.

Build with us.
